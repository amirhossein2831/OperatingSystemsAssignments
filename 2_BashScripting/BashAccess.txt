Bash, as a shell, is an interface between the user and the operating system 
(OS). It allows users to run commands, manage processes, and interact with 
the file system. However, the access and permission that Bash has depend on 
the user privileges under which it is executed, rather than Bash itself having
inherent permissions.

User Permissions Define Access: Bash inherits the permissions and capabilities of  
the user who runs it. If you're logged in as a regular user, your Bash session will 
have the same restrictions and access that your user account has. If you're logged in 
as root (the superuser), Bash will have full access to the system.

    Root User: The root user has unrestricted access to all files and commands on the system. Running Bash as root allows you to:
        Modify system files (e.g., /etc/passwd, system configurations).
        Install or uninstall software.
        Start or stop system services.
        Manage users and permissions.
    Regular User: A regular userâ€™s Bash session will have limited access to system files. You can:
        Access files you own.
        Run processes you have permission for.
        Execute programs and scripts with the necessary permissions.
        Modify files in your home directory.
